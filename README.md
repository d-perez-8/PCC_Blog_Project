# PCC Blog Web App Project
This is my first deployed web app using Python and the Django framework. With the help of [Python Crash Course](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/), I was able to delpoy my first web app.

In this project I learned how to use the Django framework in three chapters.

Chapter 17, I learned how to:

 - define models
 - migrate databases after making changes to said models
 - create a superuser for my admin site
 - define URLs
 - create view functions
 - write templates to make pages
 - template inheritance for making modifications easier
 
Chapter 18:

 - use form for users to imput and edit their own entries
 - let users create their own accounts
 - logging in and logging out system
 - build a user authentication and registration system
 - attributed data to specific users through a foriegn key relationship
 - make sure a user only sees data that belongs to them
 
 Chapter 18:
 - use the Bootstrap's library and the django-bootstrap4 app
 - use Bootstap's templates and the Navbar static template
 - use Jumbotron to make the homepage message stand out
 - style the webpage consistantly
 - deploy this project using Heroku's servers
 - git commands such as `add`, `commit`, `status`, and `push`
 - secure my app by setting `DEBUG=False` on the live server
 
 I plan on conintuing to style and incorporate new features to my web app by exploring the django and Bootstrap websites. I will study more HTML and CSS through freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).
 Furthermore, I will continue my Python studies with Al Sweigart's book [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/) to learn how to write clean code, the command line, and professional tools.
